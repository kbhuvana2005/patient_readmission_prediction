🏥 PATIENT READMISSION PREDICTION SYSTEM


**Overview**

The Patient Readmission Prediction System is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict the likelihood of a patient being readmitted to the hospital within a specified period after discharge. By analyzing patient demographics, medical history, treatment details, and hospital stay information, this system helps healthcare providers identify high-risk patients and take preventive measures.

This project leverages Big Data analytics and ML algorithms to improve patient care, reduce readmission rates, and optimize hospital resource allocation.

**Aim**

To develop a predictive model that accurately identifies patients at risk of readmission, enabling hospitals to proactively manage patient care and improve healthcare outcomes.

**Objectives**

Analyze historical patient data to identify patterns and risk factors associated with readmissions.

Build and train machine learning models to predict patient readmission probability.

Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Provide actionable insights to hospital staff for improving patient care and reducing readmissions.
